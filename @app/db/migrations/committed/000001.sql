 * 3. The "subject" column, we'll read the value of this column from the NEW

 *
 * A PostgreSQL `NOTIFY` will be issued to the topic (or "channel") generated
 * from arguments 2 and 3, the body of the notification will be a stringified
 * JSON object containing `event`, `sub` (the subject specified by argument 3)
 * and `id` (the record id).

 *
 *     create trigger _500_gql_update
