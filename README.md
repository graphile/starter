# PostGraphile Starter

## Purpose

Take this software and use it as the starting point to build your project. Go
make some money, and [give something
back](https://github.com/sponsors/benjie) to support us building
more tools and kits for the Node, GraphQL and PostgreSQL ecosystems.

Please note that this software is not "complete," free of software defects,
or free of security issues â€” it is not a "finished" solution, but rather the
seed of a solution which you should review, customise, fix, and develop
further.

It is intended that you use a "point in time" version of this software â”€ it
is not intended that you can merge updates to this software into your own
derivative in an automated fashion.

## Crowd-funded open-source software

**PLEASE DONATE.**

We've put an absolute tonne of work into this project to help you to turn
your application idea into a reality as fast as possible. Instead of putting
this code under a complex proprietary license we've made it available to you
under the simple MIT license. This gives you a huge amount of freedom in how
you use it, but it also makes it very hard for us to earn a living from our
hard work.

Work like this wouldn't be possible without the help of [our wonderful
sponsors](https://www.graphile.org/sponsor/); but we need more people to join
their ranks so we can continue to bring about awesome projects like this.
We'd love to spend more time on open source, building tools that will save
you and others even more time and money â”€ please sponsor our open source
efforts:

## Prerequisites

You can either work with this project `local` or use a pre-configured `docker` enviroment.

For users of Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a `.vscode` folder is included with
editor settings and debugger settings provided, plus a list of recommended
extensions. There is also a `.devcontainer` folder, which makes developing with
these docker containers a breeze.

### Local

- Node.js v10+ must be installed
- Either a PostgreSQL v10+ server must be available
- VSCode is recommended, but any editor will do

This software has been developed under Mac and Linux, and should work in a
`bash` environment. I'm not sure if it works under Windows; PRs to fix
Windows compatibility issues would be welcome (please keep them small!).

### Docker

- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Getting started

### One time setup (docker only)

#### Using VS Code with Remote Container Extension

A `.devcontainer` folder is provided, so you can simply develop this project with a pre-configured docker devcontainer enviroment.

- Install vscode-extension: [ms-vscode-remote.remote-container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- Type `>Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`
- Follow: [Inital Setup](#inital_setup) inside the container bash (try: `Ctrl+Shift+~`, if shell panel is hidden)

#### Just `docker-compose`

- Start next.js and PostgreSQL servers: `docker-compose up -d webapp db`
- Attach to docker container bash: `docker-compose exec webapp bash`
- Follow: [Inital Setup](#inital_setup) inside this new shell

### Inital setup

**(same for local and all docker)**

This project is designed to work with `yarn`. If you don't have `yarn`
installed, you can install it with `npm install -g yarn`. Docker setup already
has `yarn` & `npm` installed and configured

To get started, please run the `yarn setup` command which should lead you
through the necessary steps:

```
yarn && yarn setup
```

The above command will create a `.envvar` file for you containing your secrets.
Do not commit it to version control!

## Running

You can bring up the stack:

- `yarn start`
  <!--

? not sure we still need this
? maybe add reference to docker-compose.yml webapp.user property

- with Docker: `export UID; docker-compose up`
  - NOTE: the `export UID` is really important on Linux otherwise the folders will end up owned by root and everything will suck. We recommend adding `export UID` to your `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` or similar -->

After a short period you should then be able to load the application at
http://localhost:5678

<!--
? not sure we still need this, if you redo setup, it might workt
**Be careful not to mix and match Docker-mode vs local-mode.** You should
stick with the answer you gave during setup. -->

## Documentation links

### `yarn start` (or `docker-compose up`)

This main command runs a number of tasks:

- uses [`graphile-migrate`](https://github.com/graphile/migrate) to watch the`migrations/current.sql` file for changes, and automatically runs it against your database when it changes
- watches the TypeScript source code of the server, and compiles it from `@app/*/src` to `@app/*/dist` so node/`graphile-worker`/etc can run the compiled code directly
- runs the node server (includes PostGraphile and Next.js middlewares)
- runs `graphile-worker` to execute your tasks (e.g. sending emails)
- watches your GraphQL files and your PostGraphile schema for changes and generates your TypeScript React hooks for you automatically, leading to strongly typed code with minimal effort
- runs the `jest` tests in watch mode, automatically re-running as the database or test files change

For `docker-compose up` it also runs the PostgreSQL server that the system
connects to.

### Cypress e2e tests

Thanks to Cypress.io for sponsoring this work, we've added e2e tests covering
loading the various pages, registering an account, logging in, verifying and
managing your emails. You should be able to easily build on top of these
tests to ensure that your project remains rock-solid at all times.

### Next.js

We use Next.js ([docs](https://nextjs.org/)) to handle the various common
concerns of a React application for us (server-side rendering, routing,
bundling, bundle-splitting, etc). The `@app/client/src/pages/_app.tsx` file is a
[custom &lt;App&gt;](https://nextjs.org/docs#custom-app) which allows you to
add any providers you need to. We've already set it up with `withApollo` from
`@app/client/src/lib/withApollo` which includes all the Apollo configuration,
including the client URL.

### AntD

The component library we're using is AntD ([docs](https://ant.design/)); we've
demonstrated how to use the form validation components on the login/register
pages so you can see how to handle errors from the server.

### Initial database

The database is a jumping-off point; we've already committed the initial user
system for you (but you can `uncommit` this if you need to). You can add
idempotent SQL commands to `migrations/current.sql` and they will run when
you save. When you're happy with your changes, run `yarn db commit`
to commit these commands and reset `migrations/current.sql` to a blank state
ready for the next batch of changes. We deliberately do not include
functionality that we don't think most users will find useful.

### graphile-migrate

To read more about migrations with graphile-migrate, see the
[graphile-migrate docs](https://github.com/graphile/migrate).

### graphile-worker

We've added a few example workers for you, including the `send_email` worker
which performs email templating for you. See `@app/worker/src/tasks` for the
tasks we've created (and to add your own), and see the [graphile-worker
docs](https://github.com/graphile/worker) for more information.

### Server

The server entry point is `@app/server/src/index.ts`; you'll see that it
contains documentation and has split the middleware up into a manageable
fashion. We use traditional cookie sessions, but you can switch this out
for an alternative.

### Login with GitHub

If you set `GITHUB_KEY` and `GITHUB_SECRET` in your `.envvar` file then you can
also use GitHub's OAuth social authentication; you can add similar logic to the
GitHub logic (in `@app/server/src/middleware/installPassport.ts`) to enable
other social login providers such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. For more
information, see the [passport.js documentation](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/).

## Docker development notes

Docker creates the files in `.docker` as root. As these files are owned by
root you have to `sudo` to deal with them. ðŸ™„

PostgreSQL logs from Docker on stdout were overwhelming so we now write them
to the Postgres data directory `.docker/postgres_data/logs/`. We've enabled
`log_truncate_on_rotation` but you may need to prune these periodically. See
[log file
maintenance](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logfile-maintenance.html).

Our Docker setup seems to trigger more watch events than the native one, so
it seems to do more redundant work/produce more output. A PR to fix this
would be welcome!

## Building the production docker image

To build the production image, use `docker build` as shown below. You should
supply the `ROOT_URL` build variable (which will be baked into the client
code, so cannot be changed as envvars); if you don't then the defaults will
apply (which likely will not be suitable).

To build the worker, pass `TARGET="worker"` instead of the default
`TARGET="server"`.

```sh
docker build \
  --build-arg ROOT_URL="http://localhost:5678" \
  --build-arg TARGET="server" \
  .
```

When you run the image you must pass it the relevant environmental variables, for example:

```sh
docker run --rm -it --init -p 5678:5678 \
  -e GRAPHILE_LICENSE="$GRAPHILE_LICENSE" \
  -e SECRET="$SECRET" \
  -e JWT_SECRET="$JWT_SECRET" \
  -e DATABASE_VISITOR="$DATABASE_VISITOR" \
  -e DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" \
  -e AUTH_DATABASE_URL="$AUTH_DATABASE_URL" \
  -e GITHUB_KEY="$GITHUB_KEY" \
  -e GITHUB_SECRET="$GITHUB_SECRET" \
  docker-image-id-here
```

Currently if you miss required envvars weird things will happen; we don't
currently have environment validation (PRs welcome!).

## Deploying to Heroku

If you are using `graphile-migrate` make sure that you have executed
`graphile-migrate commit` to commit all your database changes, since we only
run committed migrations in production.

Make sure you have customised `@app/config/src/index.ts`.

Make sure everything is committed and pushed in git.

Set up a database server; we recommend using Amazon RDS.

Once your database server is running, you can use our `heroku-setup` script to
automate the setup process. This script does the following:

- Creates the Heroku app
- Adds the redis extension to this heroku app
- Creates the database in the database server
- Creates the relevant roles, generating random passwords for them
- Installs some common database extensions
- Sets the Heroku config variables
- Adds the heroku app as a git remote named 'heroku'
- Pushes the 'master' branch to Heroku to perform your initial build

Copy `heroku-setup.template` to `heroku-setup`, then edit it and customise the
settings at the top. We also recommend reading through the script and
customising it as you see fit - particularly if you are using additional
extensions that need installing.

Now run the script:

```
bash heroku-setup
```

Hopefully all has gone well. If not, step through the remaining tasks in the
heroku-setup script and fix each task as you go. We've designed the script so
that if your superuser credentials are wrong, or the heroku app already exists,
you can just edit the settings and try again. All other errors will probably
need manual intervention. Verbosity is high so you can track exactly what
happened.

The server should be up and running now (be sure to access it over HTTPS
otherwise you will not be able to run GraphQL queries), but it is not yet
capable of sending emails. To achieve this, you must configure an email
transport. We have preconfigured support for Amazon SES. Once SES is set up,
your domain is verified, and you've verified any emails you wish to send email
to (or have had your sending limits removed), make sure that the `fromEmail` in
`@app/config/src/index.ts` is correct, and then create an IAM role for your
PostGraphile server. Here's an IAM template for sending emails - this is the
only permission required for our IAM role currently, but you may wish to add
others later.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ses:SendRawEmail",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Generate an Access Key for this IAM role, and then tell Heroku the access key
id and secret:

```
heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..." AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..." -a $APP_NAME
```

Now you can tell Heroku to run the worker process as well as the currently running 'web' process:

```
heroku ps:scale worker=1 -a $APP_NAME
```

When you register an account on the server you should receive a verification
email containing a clickable link. When you click the link your email will be
verified and thanks to GraphQL subscriptions the previous tab should be updated
to reflect that your account is now verified.

**Remember** the first account registered will be an admin account, so be sure
to register promptly.

You can also configure your application for social login. This works the same
as in development except the callback URL will be different, something like
`https://MY_HEROKU_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/auth/github/callback`. Set the GitHub
OAuth secrets on your Heroku app to trigger a restart and enable social login:

```
heroku config:set GITHUB_KEY="..." GITHUB_SECRET="..." -a $APP_NAME
```

## Cleanup

To delete the Heroku app:

```
heroku apps:destroy -a $APP_NAME
```

To delete the database/roles (replace `dbname` with your database name):

```
drop database dbname;
drop role dbname_visitor;
drop role dbname_authenticator;
drop role dbname;
```
